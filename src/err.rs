//! Error types for template directive execution.
//!
//! This module defines the errors that can occur during template rendering,
//! particularly when resolving arguments and executing directives.

use thiserror::Error;

/// Errors that can occur during directive execution.
///
/// These errors represent runtime failures when rendering a compiled template,
/// such as missing variables, type mismatches, or parse failures. All errors
/// include detailed context to help diagnose issues.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use figura::{Template, DefaultParser, Context, Value, DirectiveError};
/// use std::collections::HashMap;
///
/// let tmpl = Template::<'{', '}'>::compile::<DefaultParser>("{missing}").unwrap();
/// let ctx = HashMap::new();
///
/// match tmpl.format(&ctx) {
///     Err(DirectiveError::NotFound { name, .. }) => {
///         println!("Variable '{}' not found", name);
///     }
///     _ => {}
/// }
/// ```

    /// This error occurs when a template references a variable that doesn't
    /// exist in the context hashmap. The error includes both the variable name
    /// and the type it was expected to be used as.
    ///
    /// # Fields
    ///
    /// * `name` - The name of the missing variable
    /// * `type_name` - The type the variable was expected to be (e.g., "string", "i64")
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// Template: "{username}"
    /// Context: (empty)

    ///
    /// # Fields
    ///
    /// * `name` - The name of the variable with the wrong type
    /// * `expected` - The type that was expected (e.g., "i64")
    /// * `found` - The actual type of the variable (e.g., "string")
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// Template: "{value:count}"  (requires count to be an integer)
    /// Context: count = "not a number"
    /// Error: Variable 'count' has type 'string' but was expected to have type 'i64'

    ///
    /// This error occurs when a literal value embedded in the template cannot
    /// be parsed into the type required by the directive. For example, trying
    /// to parse "abc" as an integer.
    ///
    /// # Fields
    ///
    /// * `value` - The literal value that failed to parse
    /// * `type_name` - The type it was being parsed as
    /// * `message` - The detailed parse error message
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```text
